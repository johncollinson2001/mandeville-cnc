A simple, promotional website for a fictitious CNC routing company.

The site uses a really neat responsive CSS library, that is styled on Google's material design principles and built ontop of Bootstrap.

The site uses asp.net core as the server back end, and has some simple email support which must be configured before it'll work. 

The forms are secured with a recaptcha, which you'll also need to configure before it'll work on your own site.
